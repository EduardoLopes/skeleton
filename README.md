# Skeleton

##### [Instruções em português](README_pt-br.md)

Boilerplate for a really simple project.

## Getting Started

To start a new project:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/vitorbritto/skeleton.git projectname
cd projectname
./init.sh
```

*Windows users can run the `init.bat` file on the command prompt. If you're using Cygwin or PowerShell, you can quietly run the `init.sh` file. :)*

**Improving your Workflow**

You can use Grunt to automate your tasks and improve your Workflow. To do that, simply execute `npm install` and then run one of the tasks bellow:

* `grunt`: will watch for changes on your files (Live Reload included).
* `grunt build`: will minify, concat and lint your files.
